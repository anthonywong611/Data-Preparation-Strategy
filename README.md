## Numerical Variables

A range of measurements describing the fact


## Context

- A context is described by a collection of levels coming from different categories

- First lay the context, then situate the fact against it

Interested in analyzing one fact against a context?

(Category_1, ..., Category_N) -> Measurement

Interested in analyzing the interactions among multiple facts against a context?

(Category_1, ..., Category_N) -> (Measurement_1, ...,  Measurement_N)
